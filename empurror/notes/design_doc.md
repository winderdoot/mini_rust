## TODO

1. Control privinces
- Separate view for provinces controlled by your/other emipires
- Add emipire components/entities
- Add hardcoded number of empires and a few provinces controlled by the player empire

2. Add turn mechanic, make the other empires skip their turn

3. Empire resources:
- Add food, stone, wood, gold and population resources (how to implement them?)
- Make systems for counting the total and income for next turn



# Initial idea

Turn based gameplay, you can do a few things per turn.
You start with a few units and a few controlled provinces. Units can move only so far in a single turn. Unocupied provinces can be claimed by building something in them. Maybe add tokens that limit how many provinces you can try to build?
